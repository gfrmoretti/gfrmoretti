I graduated as a technologist in the Systems Analysis and Development course at the Federal Institute of São Paulo.
I've been working in the area for about 5 years and until then I've acquired experience and knowledge about object-oriented programming, design patterns, design systems and cloud architecture.
All this knowledge was reinforced by the studies of SOLID, Object Calisthenics and Clean Code.

Since the beginning I have been working with Java language, developing integration drivers with third-party systems, Rest API with the Spring ecosystem and libraries for private and public use.
In addition, I also worked with Python using TornadoWeb with SQLAlchemy,C# (.NET Core 5) for Rest API and Ruby for component tests.

All the projects I worked on used Git for version control. I have experience with remote repositories on both GitHub and BitBucket. 
On github I had the opportunity to work with Github Actions for continuous integration and also the integration with the ArgoCD platform.

I created an open source library for Java: https://github.com/gfrmoretti/anmap

I worked with PostgreSQL, SQLite and MySQL relational databases, most of the time using PostgreSQL. I had experience with ORM Hibernate in Java and SQLAlchemy in Python. 
I also had experience with NoSQL data storage with Redis for caching, MongoDB and Firestore from Google Firebase.

I have experience with Docker, Docker-Compose and Linux for containers.
I also acquired knowledge with service management on AWS, GCP, Heroku and Azure platforms. At AWS I had contact with several services such as EC2, S3, CloudWatch, Lambda formulas, SQS, CodePipeline and CodeDeploy 
and knowledge in the treadmill process, both for AWS, Azure and for Heroku. At GCP and Azure I had the opportunity to manage workloads in Kubernetes cluster, work with Monitoring and logging, VM instance and networks.

I had the opportunity to work with Kubernetes and micro services at CI&T, I learn more about CI and CD processes, the test pyramid, agile development and the challenge of creating high-performance API availability and scalability.
I had the change to work with events using Kafka and RabbitMQ, I worked with EventHub in Azure thats works like a Kafka in Azure ecosystem.
I learn about Terraform and Infra As A Service and how to create scripts.

I gained experience in observability creating solutions with Prometheus and Grafana, ElasticSearch and Kibana, integrations with APM DataDog, Azure Monitoring and Application Insights,
creation of alerts and cloud monitoring with GCP, Azure and AWS.
 
Throughout my experience I acquired knowledge with NodeJS, React, NextJS, CSS, HTML, Dart/Flutter. With this I created websites for delivery system and others webpages for the company and an Android app.

I love what I do and I love learning new technologies.
